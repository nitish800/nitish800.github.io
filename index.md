## About Me

You already know my name, I completed my formal education in 2017 with my degree in Bachelor Of Computer Application, I own a retail store in a small town in  India. During day time i manage my store and at night i make the internet safe, through bug bounty and scanning the internet for interesting stuff and data leaks.


Although most of my accomplishment is masked by NDA, I will try to keep this page updated with info I am allowed to make public.
